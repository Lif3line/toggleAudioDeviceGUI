##Toggle Audio Device GUI

Simple Autohotkey script to swap between multiple audio/communications devices in a simple and effecient way.

By default hooks onto the Media Stop button on a keyboard; re-bind as necessary

Requires [Autohotkey](http://ahkscript.org/) to run since you probably shouldn't trust .exe files from some random guy on the internet.
